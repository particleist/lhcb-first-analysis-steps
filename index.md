## Topics

1.  Outline
1.  General introduction to DaVinci

4.  Minimal DaVinci on the grid
5.  Add a simple TupleTool to the job
6.  LoKi Hybrid tool

9.  Split your jobs into subjobs
10. (Stripping line efficiency)
11. How to use a stripping line for a slightly different decay

12. TisTos and what it all means
13. TupleTools for TISTOS'ing
14. (Caveats for TISTOS'ing)

15. What is DecayTreeFitter?
16. How do I use DecayTreeFitter?

Each topic should be a chunk of 10-15 minutes.
If that is too short, we should split it into several topics.
